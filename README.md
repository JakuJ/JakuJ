# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student and a Software Developer based in Poland :poland:<br/>
This is where I keep my passion projects and some of the stuff I've developed for uni.

Currently working on: my **BEng thesis** related to quantum programming and compilation. It's fun :grin:
